# Assets (moved)

Final assets now belong in `root/assets/`. This top-level `assets/` folder is kept for compatibility but the canonical location is `root/assets/`.

Keep large media out of the main repo; use Git LFS or external hosting for big files.
Store images, audio, icons, and other media here. Keep large binaries out of version control when possible; use LFS or external hosting for final assets.
