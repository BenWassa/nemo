## Hero

* [x] **H1 (final headline)**
  Filmseele: The Odyssey Beneath the Waves

* [x] **Kicker / logline (1–2 sentences, narrative‑mythic)**
  The sea is wide, but the heart is deeper. This series follows Marlin and Nemo through loss, courage, and hard‑won trust—reading Pixar’s ocean as a map of the inner life, where every current tests how we cling, and how we finally let go.

## Episodes section (cards)

*(Use 1–2 sentences per card; tone = narrative‑mythic, hinting at theme without plot‑dump.)*

* [x] **Act I — The Wound & the Call** — story recap
  A father marked by loss builds a small fortress of fear—until the ocean takes his son and calls him into waters he can’t control.
* [x] **Act IIa — Road of Trials** — story recap
  Allies arrive in unlikely forms: a forgetful guide, a scarred mentor, and dangers that teach the cost—and grace—of trust.
* [x] **Act IIb — Deepening Crisis** — story recap
  The sea turns severe: jellyfish, shadows, and failing hope. Yet in the flow of the current, control loosens and wisdom breathes.
* [x] **Act III — Ordeal & Transformation** — story recap
  At the edge of despair, father and son face a kind of death—and return changed, choosing love that releases rather than grips.

## Characters section (cards)

*(1–2 sentence blurbs; keep each one archetype‑anchored.)*

* [x] **Marlin — Tragic Father**
  Fear taught him to hold tight; the journey teaches him to love without the fist. His arc bends from vigilance to trust.
* [x] **Nemo — Wounded Son**
  Small fin, fierce heart. He learns that courage is not the absence of limits, but the will to move with them.
* [x] **Dory — Divine Helper**
  Memory frays; presence shines. Her simple faith in the next stroke becomes a wisdom deeper than foresight.
* [x] **Gill — Wise Mentor**
  Scarred but unbroken, he gives Nemo the gift of risk—the permission to try and to become.
* [x] **Crush — Sage Guide**
  Ride the current; don’t fight the sea. His ease reframes parenting as release with a watchful eye.
* [x] **Bruce — Shadow Ally**
  Appetite given discipline. He is the reminder that even the deep tooth can learn another way.

## Themes — Reef Map (chips)

*(single‑sentence summaries; Tier‑2 clarity with Tier‑3 cadence.)*

* [x] **Fear & Courage**
  Trauma builds walls; courage lets the tide pass through without washing us away.
* [x] **Overprotection & Autonomy**
  Love that clutches becomes a cage; love that trusts becomes a harbor.
* [x] **Trust & Flow**
  You cannot steer every wave; you can learn the current and be carried wisely.
* [x] **Death & Rebirth**
  Near‑loss breaks the shell of certainty so a truer life can surface.
* [x] **Integration**
  The return is home made new—same reef, different heart.

* [x] **Short description for home episode list**
  Companion talks for each act: brisk, thematic, and practical—built for reflection, not recap.

---

## Extras section

* [x] **Behind the Scenes blurb**
