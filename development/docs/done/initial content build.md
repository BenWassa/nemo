Notes / next steps
- If you want, I can pre-fill each checklist item with starter copy (short paragraphs and bullets) so you can iterate faster. Tell me which page to start with and I will draft initial copy into this document or directly into the HTML pages.
- I can also export a CSV or JSON version if you prefer a spreadsheet or tracker format.
