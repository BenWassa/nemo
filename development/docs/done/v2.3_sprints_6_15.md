### Tasks:
1. Implement particle pooling system to reuse DOM elements
2. Add `requestAnimationFrame` throttling for smooth 60fps
3. Pause animations when hub sections are not visible
4. Optimize fish animation using CSS transforms only
5. Add performance monitoring and FPS counter (dev mode)

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Consistent 60fps during navigation transitions
- Reduced memory usage through object pooling

## Sprint Execution Notes for LLM Agents:

### File Change Patterns:
- **Single-file sprints** (6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15): Focus on one primary file with minimal dependencies
- **Content-focused sprints** (8, 10, 14): Apply consistent patterns across multiple content pages
- **Integration sprints** (9): Enhance existing functionality without breaking changes

### Testing Approach:
- Each sprint includes specific acceptance criteria
- Test in Chrome DevTools mobile view for responsive sprints
- Use browser's hash navigation and back/forward buttons for validation
- Check console for errors during all interactions

### Dependencies:
- Sprint 6 must complete before Sprint 7 (hash navigation foundation)
- Sprint 8 enables Sprint 14 (anchor links needed for cross-references)
- Sprint 10 depends on Sprint 6 (return context needs hash navigation)
- Sprints 11-13 can run in parallel after Sprint 9

*Each sprint is designed to be completed independently by an LLM coding agent with clear file targets and specific implementation requirements.*
