# Extras — Fill Checklist (with draft copy)

## Page title & intro

* [x] **H1:** Explore the Depths Further
* [x] **Intro (1–2 sentences, narrative‑mythic):**
  Our voyage didn’t end at the reef. These notes chart how we built Filmseele—what shaped the work, what we read, and who swam alongside us—so you can trace the current for your own journey.

## Behind the Scenes (`#behind-scenes`)

* [x] **Section title:** Behind the Scenes: The Creative Voyage
* [x] **Paragraph (4–6 sentences):**
  Filmseele began as a question: could a family film bear the weight of myth and psychology without losing its warmth? We mapped acts first, letting structure hold the sea. Then we read the story the way divers read water—by light, by pull, by what resists. Drafts were pared back until only the current remained: clear sections, spare language, room to breathe. What you see is a skeleton by design, a site that invites meaning to accrete like coral.
* [x] **Bullets (pick 3–5):**

  * Method: act grid → archetype tags → theme chips → podcast beats
  * Voice: Tier‑3 narrative‑mythic for body; Tier‑2 clarity for micro‑copy
  * Design: ocean variables, wave dividers, large tap targets, AA contrast
  * Discipline: placeholders only; content grows in deliberate passes
  * Reflection hooks: a one‑line prompt at the end of each act

## Resources (`#resources`)

* [x] **Section title:** Resources: The Mythic & Psychic Ocean
* [x] **Lead (1–2 sentences):**
  A small shelf for deep water—core texts that frame story as a map of psyche, plus references for oceanic symbolism.
* [x] **Curated list (aim 8–12 items; keep terse):**

  * **Joseph Campbell — *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*** (monomyth foundations)
  * **Christopher Vogler — *The Writer’s Journey*** (practical archetype mapping)
  * **Carl Jung — *Man and His Symbols*** (images of the unconscious)
  * **Marie‑Louise von Franz — *Archetypal Patterns in Fairy Tales*** (initiation & transformation)
  * **James Hillman — *The Soul’s Code*** (calling, character, fate)
  * **Robert McKee — *Story*** (narrative structure and beat craft)
  * **Pixar storytelling talks** (clarity, emotion, economy)
  * **Ocean symbolism references** (water as unconscious; currents as fate/flow)
  * **Parenting & autonomy essays** (scaffolding, secure base, letting go)
  * **Trauma & resilience primers** (how vigilance becomes a style of love)
* [x] **Note (optional):** Add links later; keep this list print‑friendly for now.

## Credits (`#credits`)

* [x] **Section title:** Credits: The Crew
* [x] **Paragraph (2–4 sentences):**
  A project is a pod. Filmseele was carried by steady hands and clear eyes—the ones who shaped the skeleton, tuned the voice, and kept the current kind. Our thanks flow to those who held the rope while we swam.
* [x] **Role lines (template; replace bracketed text):**

  * **Concept & Narrative:** \[Name / Handle] — act map, archetypes, themes
  * **Writing & Editing:** \[Name / Handle] — Tier‑3 body copy, prompts
  * **Design & Front‑End:** \[Name / Handle] — index & CSS system
  * **Audio Production:** \[Name / Handle] — trailer & episode companions
  * **Advisors / Readers:** \[Names] — psychology, myth, pedagogy
  * **Special Thanks:** \[Names / communities] — early swims & feedback

## Micro‑polish (optional)

* [x] Keep each card to \~120–150 words + 3–5 bullets for scan speed.
* [x] Mirror the **Resources** items on Notion with a lightweight database later (tags: myth, psych, craft, ocean).
* [x] Add a single‑line **ethos** below the Back button if desired:
  *“Story is a reef; return as often as you need.”*
