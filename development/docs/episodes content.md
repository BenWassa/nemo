## Page title & intro

* [x] **Title:** Episodes: The Acts
* [x] **Intro paragraph (Tier‑3):**
  Every odyssey is two journeys at once: the miles we swim and the miles within. These acts chart Marlin and Nemo across both seas—the literal waters of risk and the inner waters of fear, trust, and return.

## Act I — The Wound & the Call (`#act-1`)

* [x] **Full story recap (5–7 sentences):**
  The reef opens in light and shatters in an instant. A barracuda leaves Marlin with a single son and a heart clenched like a fist. He builds safety into a doctrine: every current suspect, every edge a threat. On the first day of school, Nemo strains against the leash of love and swims beyond the line, a small act of defiance that breaks the surface—and he is taken. The ocean widens into absence. Marlin, who has spent years refusing the unknown, must now follow it into its depths.
* [x] **Deep analysis (themes, beats, emotional arc):**

  * **Trauma → Control:** Vigilance as love’s armor; safety becomes a shrine.
  * **Inciting Loss:** Kidnapping reframes the ocean as the psyche’s abyss.
  * **Archetypal frame:** *Tragic Father, Wounded Son, Lost Innocence.*
  * **Emotional arc:** From brittle certainty → rupture → reluctant pursuit.
* [x] **Notable moments (bullets):**

  * Eggs, the scar, and the promise: “I’ll never let anything happen to you.”
  * The school drop‑off anxiety spiral.
  * Touching the boat: autonomy collides with prohibition.
  * The mask, bubbles, and the first clue of a way forward.

## Act IIa — Road of Trials (`#act-2a`)

* [x] **Full story recap:**
  Marlin meets Dory, whose forgetfulness disarms his fear with a stranger grace: presence. Together they descend into dark mouths and comic hazards—sharks who practice restraint, an anglerfish whose light is a lure. Meanwhile, in the dentist’s tank, Nemo meets Gill, scarred and steady, who offers the one thing Marlin never could: permission to risk. The two roads run in parallel; both father and son acquire unlikely teachers.
* [x] **Analysis:**

  * **Allies & Thresholds:** Help arrives mis-labeled (fool, predator, captive).
  * **Skills of soul:** Mindfulness (Dory), grit and agency (Gill).
  * **Archetypal frame:** *Reluctant Hero, Wise Mentor, Threshold Guardians.*
  * **Emotional arc:** Fear negotiates with trust; control loosens by degrees.
* [x] **Notable moments:**

  * “Just keep swimming” as a discipline, not a joke.
  * Shark pledge; appetite under covenant.
  * The mask reading—language as lifeline.
  * Gill’s scar as credential: pain that teaches.

## Act IIb — Deepening Crisis (`#act-2b`)

* [x] **Full story recap:**
  The sea turns severe. A field of jellyfish tests body and bond; Marlin falls, Dory falters, and hope thins. Then the East Australian Current catches them—an effortless river through the chaos—where Crush fathers by letting go, watching without gripping. In the tank, the escape plan sharpens; failure and near‑success teach Nemo what courage costs and grants.
* [x] **Analysis:**

  * **Escalation:** Overwhelm, exhaustion, and the temptation to harden.
  * **Flow vs. Force:** The EAC as image of trust—ride the current, don’t fight the ocean.
  * **Archetypal frame:** *Shadow tests, Shapeshifters, Zen Mentor.*
  * **Emotional arc:** From clenched effort → surrendered movement.
* [x] **Notable moments:**

  * Jellyfish gauntlet and the “game” that becomes ordeal.
  * EAC family: modeling confident release.
  * Tank filter scheme: small heroism rehearsed.
  * Marlin’s first unguarded laughter—grief briefly lifts.
* [x] **Links:** Characters (Crush) · Podcast Ep 3

## Act III — Ordeal & Transformation (`#act-3`)

* [x] **Full story recap:**
  The whale swallows them, and Marlin must choose: resist the unknown or trust its vast intelligence. He lets go—and they are carried to Sydney. In the harbor’s churn, Nemo and Marlin miss, find, and nearly lose one another again; the death‑feint breaks the last shell of control. When the net rises and the sea screams, Nemo leads, Marlin yields, and together they teach a crowd to swim downward—to break the machine with shared will.
* [x] **Analysis:**

  * **Ordeal as Surrender:** Ego yields to something larger (the whale, the we).
  * **Death/Rebirth:** The son “dies,” the father’s fear dies with him.
  * **Archetypal frame:** *Transformed Hero, Renewed Child, Divine Helper.*
  * **Emotional arc:** Despair → revelation → communal action.
* [x] **Notable moments:**

  * Inside the whale: “He says it’s time to let go.”
  * The harbor reunion misfire and return.
  * The net—downward salvation through coordinated trust.
  * “I know I can” replaces “You can’t.”

## Act IV — Return & Integration (`#act-4`)

* [x] **Full story recap:**
  The reef is unchanged, and everything is different. Marlin blesses the risk he once forbade; Nemo swims out into the day without the weight of his father’s fear. Dory belongs now—not as a guest but as kin. The adventure settles into practice: vigilance softened by trust, love measured not by how tightly it holds but by how freely it sends.
* [x] **Analysis:**

  * **Integration:** Wound remembered, no longer ruling.
  * **Community Healing:** Private courage ripples into public ease.
  * **Archetypal frame:** *Integrated Self, Mentor Transformed, Circle Restored.*
  * **Emotional arc:** From survival mode → ordinary grace.
* [x] **Notable moments:**

  * School send‑off; the unknotted goodbye.
  * Dory’s place in the family.
  * The reef as home and horizon.
* [x] **Links:** Podcast Ep 5

### Micro‑edits that will make the page sing

* Keep your `archetypes` lines aligned with Index labels (they already match).
* Add a one‑line **“Reflection Prompt”** at the end of each act (optional), e.g.,

  * *Act I prompt:* “Where has fear taught you to hold too tightly? What would following the current look like for one step?”
* If you want timestamps later, leave `(timestamp: mm:ss)` placeholders in the notable bullets.
