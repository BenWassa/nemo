# Characters — Fill Checklist (with draft copy)

## Page intro (top paragraph)

> **Key Characters & Archetypes**
> Every odyssey is carried by companions—some gentle, some toothy. These figures are more than fish; they are shapes of the soul: fear that clutches, courage that releases, memory that returns us to the present, and wisdom that learns to ride the current.

## Micro‑polish (optional)

* Add a tiny **“Reflection”** line at the bottom of each card (if you have room):

  * *Marlin:* Where has caution become a cage?
  * *Nemo:* What limit could become a path?
  * *Dory:* Where can presence replace prediction?
  * *Gill:* What risk would honor your growth?
  * *Crush:* What current can you trust today?
