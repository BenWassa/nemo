# Themes — Fill Checklist (with draft copy)

## Page intro (top paragraph)

> **Themes: The Reef Map**
- [x] Meaning gathers like reefs: small accretions of choice, fear, and hope that shape the waters we swim. These themes are waypoints—mythic names for ordinary courage—so the voyage through story can become a voyage through self.

---

## Fear & Courage (`#fear-courage`)

**Lead (1–2 sentences):**
- [x] Trauma builds walls; courage lets the tide pass through without washing us away. In this ocean, bravery is not noise—it is breath kept steady in dark water.

**Bullets (choose 2–4):**
- [x] **Origin of fear:** The opening loss teaches Marlin that vigilance is love; the reef shrinks to the size of his worry.
- [x] **Cost of control:** Safety becomes a shrine that slowly starves curiosity and joy.
- [x] **Practice of courage:** Dory models a quieter bravery—one more stroke, one more try.
- [x] **Scene anchors:** The drop‑off defiance; shark meeting under a pledge; jellyfish gauntlet endured together.
- [x] **(Optional) Reflection:** Where has fear disguised itself as care in your life?

## Overprotection & Autonomy (`#overprotection-autonomy`)

**Lead:**
- [x] Love that clutches becomes a cage; love that trusts becomes a harbor. Autonomy is not abandonment—it is blessing with a watchful eye.

**Bullets:**
- [x] **Parental arc:** Marlin’s grip is a prayer against loss; learning to release is his devotion matured.
- [x] **Child’s claim:** Nemo seeks space not to rebel, but to become. Limits remain; agency grows.
- [x] **Mentorship contrast:** Gill grants risk inside constraint; Crush models release inside watchfulness.
- [x] **Scene anchors:** “You think you can do these things, but you just can’t”; EAC parenting; tank plan green‑lit.
- [x] **Reflection:** What release would honor someone you love?

---

## Trust & Flow (`#trust-flow`)

**Lead:**
- [x] You cannot steer every wave; you can learn the current and be carried wisely. Trust is not passivity—it is skill at moving with what is larger than you.

**Bullets:**
- [x] **From force to flow:** Control exhausts; the EAC reveals a kinder strength—alignment.
- [x] **Faith as practice:** Dory’s presence turns panic into rhythm: “Just keep swimming.”
- [x] **Surrender moment:** Inside the whale, Marlin chooses to let go and discovers providence has teeth of mercy.
- [x] **Scene anchors:** Mask reading by fragments; EAC ride; whale’s belly.
- [x] **Reflection:** Where could you trade effort for alignment?

---

## Death & Rebirth (`#death-rebirth`)

**Lead:**
- [x] Every true journey nears a death—of certainty, of strategy, of self—so a truer life can surface.

**Bullets:**
- [x] **Symbolic deaths:** The barracuda’s attack (innocence), the jellyfish fall (capacity), Nemo’s “death” feint (control).
- [x] **Rebirths:** Marlin’s trust resurrected; Nemo’s leadership born; community saved by swimming down together.
- [x] **Mythic frame:** Descent, ordeal, return—old selves shed like shells on the sea floor.
- [x] **Scene anchors:** Harbor despair to reunion; net descent as communal resurrection.
- [x] **Reflection:** What old certainty must drown for you to live differently?

---

## Integration (`#integration`)

**Lead:**
- [x] The return is home made new: same reef, different heart. Wisdom becomes habit; love learns to send as well as shield.

**Bullets:**
- [x] **Aftermath:** Vigilance softens into attentive care; anxiety becomes awareness.
- [x] **Belonging widened:** Dory is no longer a guest but kin; community inherits the courage of two.
- [x] **Ongoing practice:** Trust is not an event but a rhythm kept in ordinary days.
- [x] **Scene anchors:** School send‑off without the knot; easy banter at the reef; open horizon.
- [x] **Reflection:** How will you practice what the ocean taught you—today, at home?

### Micro‑polish (optional)

- [x] Keep each card left‑aligned (as in your CSS) and limit to \~90–120 words total for scannability.
- [x] If you want hover tooltips on the chips from the Index page later, reuse each theme’s **Lead** sentence as the tooltip text for consistency.
