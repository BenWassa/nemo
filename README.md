# 🎬 Movie Miniseries: Finding Nemo

**Movie Miniseries: Finding Nemo** reimagines Pixar’s classic as a mythic, psychologically informed miniseries.
This repo ships a **style‑first HTML/CSS skeleton** with strict placeholders, plus a professor‑level act framework.
Content is added later; UX/UI quality is first‑class.

## ✨ What’s inside
- 4–5 act breakdown (Film Studies + Psychology)
- Themes & archetypes mapped to key beats
- Commissioning brief for LLM/dev handoff
- Polished HTML/CSS site skeleton (placeholders only)
- Podcast scaffolding (trailer + episodes)

## 🧭 How to use
1. Watch film, jot focus notes (e.g., trauma → overprotection; trust/flow).
2. Run the **Master Prompt** in `/prompts` with your inputs.
3. Edit `/site/index.html` + `/site/site.css` (structure/style only).
4. Expand docs in `/docs` when you’re ready for real content.
